# :computer: Assignment 01

## Requirements
- Solve one problem statement from each set
- Write the solution to each problem statement in its corresponding Python module (`p1.py`, `p2.py` and `p3.py` respectively).
- Use functions, input parameters and return values
- Each function only does one thing!
- Do not use global variables
- Provide the user relevant messages regarding expected input and the meaning of the programâ€™s output.

## Problem Statements
### First Set
4. For a given natural number `n` find the largest natural number written with the same digits. (e.g. `n=3658, m=8653`).

### Second Set
8. Find the smallest number `m` from the Fibonacci sequence, defined by `f[0]=f[1]=1`, `f[n]=f[n-1] + f[n-2]`, for `n > 2`, larger than the given natural number `n`. (e.g. `for n = 6, m = 8`).

### Third Set
14. Determine the `n-th` element of the sequence `1,2,3,2,2,5,2,2,3,3,3,7,2,2,3,3,3,...` obtained from the sequence of natural numbers by replacing composed numbers with their prime divisors, each divisor `d` being written `d` times, without memorizing the elements of the sequence.
