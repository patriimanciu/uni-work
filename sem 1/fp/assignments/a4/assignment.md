# ðŸ’» Assignment 04 - Problem Solving Methods

## Requirements
- You will have to solve two problem statements from the list below, one using the **backtracking** programming method and one using the **dynamic programming** method.
- For the backtracking problem, implement both an iterative as well as a recursive algorithm (**deadline is week 5**).
- For the dynamic programming problem, implement both the naive, non-optimized version as well as the dynamic programming version (**deadline is week 6**). 
- For the dynamic programming implementation, display the data structure used to memorize the intermediate results and be able to explain how it works. 
- For all implementations understand and be able to explain the computational complexity with regards to runtime.

## Problem Statements
### Backtracking
13. The sequence a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> of distinct integer numbers is given. Display all subsets with a mountain aspect. A set has a mountain aspect if the elements increase up to a point and then they decrease. E.g. `10, 16, 27, 18, 14, 7`.

### Dynamic Programming
6. Given an array of integers `A`, maximize the value of the expression `A[m] - A[n] + A[p] - A[q]`, where `m, n, p, q` are array indices with `m > n > p > q`. For `A = [30, 5, 15, 18, 30, 40]`, the maximum value is `32`, obtained as `40 - 18 + 15 - 5`. Display both the maximum value as well as the expression used to calculate it.
