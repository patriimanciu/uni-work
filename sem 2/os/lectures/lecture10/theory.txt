prb 1: you have a bunch of kids trying to go into a bathroom stall
trylock() -> either locks or returns a value
    -> problem with kids and bathroom stalls
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        lock(&m[i]);
        1 go
        unlock(&m[i]);
    }
    -> this will make everyone wait for the first stall, not distribute them

prb 2: elevator -> more kilos than allowed, the elevator keeps locking

prb 3: trampoline -> only a specific number of kids can jump at a time

prb 4: forest -> bees and bears
    -> bees make honey, bears eat honey
    -> ranger kicks in when there's no honey
