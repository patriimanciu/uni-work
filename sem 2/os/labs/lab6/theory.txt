we have to be super precies with the interpreter
* for permision (user, group or other), use chmod +x filename or chmod 755 filename

 #!/bin/bash -> this is the interpreter <-> /bin/bash a.sh
 $1 -> first argument in the command line
 argv -> $@ -> all arguments in the command line
 argc -> $# -> number of arguments in the command line

tabs are important in bash, just like in python
$ works like a pointer in bash
B=1 would add a value to a variable, while $B would get the value of the variable
* if you want to use a variable in the command line, use $variable
