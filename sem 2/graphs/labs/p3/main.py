# 7. Write a program that, given a graph with costs that has no negative cost cycles and two vertices,
# finds a lowest cost walk between the given vertices. The program shall use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
# Note: computing the minimum cost walk (as some kind of a list of vertices) is a mandatory part of the assignment.
